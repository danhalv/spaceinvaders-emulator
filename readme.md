# Space Invaders - Emulator
This is an emulation of the 1978 arcade machine used to play Space Invaders written in C. The emulator consists of two parts: the Intel 8080 CPU found inside the machine and the rest of the hardware necessary to run the game.

## How to build

##### ROMs
First of all the project requires the ROM files for the game. These are copyrighted and can't be uploaded with the project, but can be found online. 
In the project folder they should be saved in a folder called **/res/roms/**. The following files are required:
* _invaders.e_
* _invaders.f_
* _invaders.g_
* _invaders.h_

Building the project requires a **C compiler** and is easiest built using **make**.

##### Dependencies:
* SDL2

#### Ubuntu 18.04
1) Get SDL2 library:

        sudo apt install libsdl2-dev

2)  In project folder, run:
    * gcc:
    
            make && ./spaceinvaders
            
    * clang or other compiler:
    
            make CC=clang && ./spaceinvaders
